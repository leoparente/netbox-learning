## Device Alerter Agent

By default the Reachability Agent waits for messages to appear on the `$SUBSCRIBE_SUBJECT` subject and then the device reported in the message is not present in the NetBox inventory, the agent publishes a message to Slack.

### Configuration

The agent is configured on start up by the `.env` file in the agent's directory. We assume that you have already created a Slack app.

```
cat agents/reachability_alerter/example.env 
NATS_SERVER="127.0.0.1:4222"                    # NATs server to connect to
SUBSCRIBE_SUBJECT="network.devices.reachable"   # NATs subject to subscribe to. The agent runs when a message is receieved
SLACK_TOKEN="YOUR SLACK TOKEN"                  # Slack App Token
SLACK_USERNAME="YOUR SLACK BOT USERNAME"        # Slack username to publish as
SLACK_CHANNEL="YOUR SLACK CHANNEL"              # Slack channel to publish to
```
